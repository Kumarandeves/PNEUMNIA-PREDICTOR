#PNEUMNIA-PREDICTOR

Overview:

This project leverages the Random Forest algorithm to detect pneumonia from medical image data. Using a large dataset of chest X-ray images, the model classifies images into categories indicative of pneumonia or healthy conditions. This predictive model aims to aid in early detection, contributing to quicker diagnosis and treatment.

Features:

1.Data Preprocessing: Techniques for image preprocessing, including normalization and augmentation.
2.Modeling: Implementation of the Random Forest classifier for image-based predictions. 
3.Evaluation: Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for assessing model efficacy. 4.Visualization: Insights into model performance through confusion matrices and ROC curves.

Technology Stack:

1.Programming Language: Python
2.Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn, OpenCV 
3.Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Installation and Usage:

1.Clone the repository.
2.Install dependencies via requirements.txt. 
3.Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the model. Future Work:

1.Enhancing the model using advanced techniques. 
2.Incorporating additional machine learning models for comparative analysis.
3.Expanding the dataset for better generalization.
